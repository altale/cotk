i don' t particularly like complicated .
nothing ever out of place .
not good to break the rules .
come back any time .
you broke the rules .

she had a gun on jack .
i know , but what has that got to do with anything ?

master says show him the way into mordor .
but we musn' t let him have it .
mr. frodo , no !
ride out and meet him head on .
eomer is loyal to you .
eomer cannot help us .
and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire .
there' s only one way to eat a brace of coneys .
and the dwarves just , spring out of holes in the ground !
our people are safe .
the women and children ?
you have my love father .
the eye of sauron now turns to gondor . . the last free kingdom of men .
for sauron will have dominion over all life on this earth . . even until the ending of the world .
all isengard is emptied .
i know how to defend my own keep .
no we won' t .
creatures i had known from nut and acorn .
he tried to kill him !
i think at last we understand one another , frodo baggins .
all our hopes now lie with two little hobbits . . somewhere in the wilderness .
but the fat hobbit .
why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind ?
it' s the trees .
sounds like orc mischief to me !
you were not so very different from a hobbit once .
this forest is old .
because master did not ask .
the walls of your bower closing in about you .
alas that these evil days should be mine .
he' s only doing what he thinks is best for his people .
he thinks he' s leading them to safety .
i' ve seen you .
arwen' s time is ending .
i will not leave my daughter here to die .
get them out of here !
sauron is marshaling an army .
smagol , listen to me .
how did it come to this ?
let' s hope they last the night .
well , that' s good news .
the castle is breached .
by rights , we shouldn' t even be here .
and it' s worth fighting for .
he is not welcome .
get out of my way !
what is still doing to him .
you' re not eating .
it' s victory is at hand .
isengard . . has been unleashed .
the quest will claim his life .
aragorn , son of arathorn and boromir of gondor .

i have fought many wars , master dwarf .

to stand against the might of sauron and saruman . . and the union of the two towers ?
i don' t wanna go , mama !
i will find you there .
only children to your eyes .
they will see us !
do not let him speak .
to have no technique .
when the opponent expands , i contract .
i' m ashamed to tell you now .
hello , mr. braithwaite .
all real bricks and boards .
she did not drown .
and come out in one piece to give it to you .
any bloody fool can pull a trigger .
where are you going ?
i was outside , but i wasn' t the only one .
indeed , a man' s strength flows from his appetites .
yes , and young skywalker as well .
may the force be with you , commander .
it would not be so easy to defeat a sith .
you' re supposed to be in space , leading our forces .
call you i will if assistance i require .
need immediate evac from planet hypori !
senator , negotiations are continuing with the separatists .
i have experienced the misery of war " first hand ; i do not wish to do it " again .
all will lose their freedom .
we are keepers of the peace , not soldiers .
to see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart .
no assassin will try that way .
padawan . and they are more then willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds .
why do i think you are going to be the death of me ?
i will be most grateful for your speed , master jedi .
i hope he doesn' t try anything foolish .
it wouldn' t have to be that way . we could keep it a secret .
it' s the situation . the stress . . the view .
all right , i get the picture . whatever happened to him ?
we will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions .
please , please , i don' t wish to have emergency powers .
it' s up to you .
i' ve done all i can for you .
no , but i do , senator .
i am grateful you are here , master kenobi .
and you will pay attention to my lead .
perhaps with merely your presence . the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed .
your patience has paid off .
representative binks , i know i can count on you .
i am truly thankful to be his apprentice .
that' s impossible , isn' t it ?
he' s still a padawan learner .
i' il guarantee that .
i have successfully made contact with the prime minister of kamino .
where' s this month' s payment ?
eight strongboxes of money .

what are you doing there ?
let' s see you now .

retreat to your exits .
neo , please , i have a son , jacob , aboard the gnosis .
i can' t do that .
and believe me , i know , the only way to get there is together .
you destroyed me , mr. anderson .
although it has been suggested that this is the same kind of attack . . we' ve defended for years , i urge the council to realize the truth .
we are looking for the keymaker .
soon the why and the reason are gone . . and all that matters is the feeling itself .
our only hope , our only peace , is to understand it , to understand the why .
only the one can open the door . . and only during that window can the door be opened .
ergo , some of my answers you will understand and some you will not .
why am i here ?
the function of the one . . is now to return to the source , allowing a dissemination of the code you carry . . reinserting the prime program .
yes mister , i will make it .
but we know well that the reason for which we are here . . it is for our likeness for the disobedience .
i never heard of him .
now it is with lock .
i already told you , boy .
with the due respect , major , there is only a way to save the city .
we don' t want to create panic .
you should be running off with in arms .
you believe that cass thinks that it is fair that i am here and dozer not ?
it is a pretty night .
if we wanted , we would rot to break them in pieces .
and what reason is that ?
then , he/ she knew the rules , he/ she knew that that you it supposes that he/ she should make , but i didn' t make it .
i' m sure he has reasons . . but the more i think about it , the more i think it' s meant to be .
are you thinking what i' m thinking ?
i remember you were pretty good .
is that why there are no young men on the council ?
maybe i' il stand .
there are programs running all over the place .
i don' t know what he was doing .
it' ii wipe out our defense system .
how do you know that ?
to say how much i loved you .
but you brought me back .
i have your word ?
what happened to my friend ?
that heroin will be very expensive indeed , leaving myself and the phone company the only two going monopolies in this nation for years to come .
well , having set the example , i don' t expect miss solitaire to be any less the lady .
i want those two men and their boats apprehended immediately !
i was hoping you would join me to drink to the future .
now what are you doing ?
no sign of niobe or ghost .
ak , i want you on holographics .
and make sure we are running on as few pads as possible .
the link is controlled by a program called the trainman .
he may never see another face for the rest of his life .
you do not understand .
i can' t help you !
get on the train or you' il stay here with him .
i need to speak with him .
what does that mean ?
we understand that you' ve requested additional volunteers .
and if i were out there and he were here , i know what he' d do .
ain' t that the goddamn truth .
i have to go .
and this ship will go to hell long before i let you take it anywhere .
what if i blew that emp ?
i knew it the moment you said you had to leave .
he fired that emp .
we' re still generating too hot a field .
victorious , the machines now turned to the vanquished .
the choice isnt that hard .
he s not real .
you were testing me ?
that , that was what was that ?
well , hes in another world now .
we' re cut off !
banished from humanity , the machines sought refuge in their own promised land .
the wish to return to an ordinary life .
anyway , it' s done and it' s all been settled with them .
this is really crazy .
may i have your attention , please .
his nose is bleeding .
i' il tell you something .
we' il continue monitoring him for a while , but anticipate no problems .
i know it wasn' t a dream .
a newly fashioned symbiotic relationship between the two adversaries was born .
we know the truth now .
no one will ever beat my record .
. so i' il just say good luck to you .
i' il tell you something .
he will never run again .
bill always said you were one of the best ladies he ever saw with an edge weapon .

we don' t have to outrun them long , just long enough .
anything that we can afford to lose . see that it' s lost !
it holds fair now that you return the favor .
so i' il be having that dress back before you go .
probably have your bloody friend norrington to thank for that .
i love this song !
now , to be quite honest with you . there' s still a slight risk for those aboard the dauntless which includes the future mrs. commodore .

and this is how you thank me ?
