battlestar atlantia has been destroyed .
i' m not sure he' s going to respond very well to that request .
fifty kiloton thermonuclear detonation .
i want you to get out of there .
cables received from english , french and german news agencies now confirm the attack was not limited to the city .
in the meantime , see what you can do with that thing .

nice limo you got there .

or fly if you will .
here' s a photograph of the missing student .
it' s all out there in the air .
i' ve left you something for your visit . with the roses tonight .
this man has no such interest in your daughter .
so your agenda is what ?

he' s been at this for years .
he bragged to his executioner . ' they think that when i die .
obviously highly capable and we consider him a serious adversary .
take " k " street and double back .
you can draw your own conclusions .
i am grateful that the f. b. i. is here .

he' s he' s at the mandarin in belville .
and if i discover i can' t , i know where to find you .
this is off speed .
but what about the officers ?
what flaming genius thought of sending us . to that dump of a flying club ?
it takes far too long .
look , damn it , my squadron' s come south .
if we lose the war now . they' il tear our arses asunder .
his bombers will lose much of their protection .
the fighters are always there .
we lost thirty fighters with ten of the pilots safe .

the tattoo on his arm .
pilot officer , switch off your engine now !
abandoned without a shot ?
you don' t have any documents on you ?

lieutenant , you' il be in the doorway .

an insect , probably .
where did you find them , pistolero ?
you have a musical ear , svedborg .
those people will fight to prove a point .
i don' t know if i like that .

and you still have me .
i know you talked , but you got him alone .
we' il die of thirst
lf you shoot again , i' il reflect the bullet directly into your heart
how many metres have we dug now ?

going for the musselshell .
lf you don' t get in too much trouble with all that hair .
and whereabouts you heading ?
i just gotta catch them off guard .
that' s the way they' s taught the nation .
i put my faith in the good book .
i ain' t got no time .
i think they beat me .
where' d you get them cannons ?
that' s a whole mess of gold .
they always send the key separate .
i got stuck with ohio bank notes .
somebody close the back door ?
it' s the best .
' cause after all , what is our miserable history . compared to yours ?
i flew 12, 000 miles for a cocksucker of a contact .
it' s all under control .
here . he is surveilling sung as we were waiting for the contact to arrive .
left the room to pee , and next thing we know . he' s knocked out the bodyguards , killed sung and the prostitute .
so i' il have to let you go , you and your precious .
this is so nice .
with a billion of them , do you think they' il miss one or two ?
i can' t walk the streets all night .

your scruples do you credit , but this is domestic business .
what' s the matter ?
i' m sorry about the indian .

well , pardon me to think so , but it' s not very good .
you don' t need it .
you know , audrey , all this has . well , it' s made me realise what a fool i' ve been .
what are you telling me ?
you still a guest of the government ?
i didn' t give you enough credit .
this is just nuts .
we have clearance for takeoff .
let' s get to know each other .
you won' t believe what happened to me last night .
jess says he' s hit some sort of a void .
no , you' re not .
we' re on our own , quinn .
he' s a dragon slayer !
copy that , van zan .
i' ve got a castle full of them .
the volunteer section of this campaign' s now over .
you , you , you !
you' re not my father .
now , one shot' s gonna kill him , and it' s gonna be with this .
what do you think ?
. i shall always walk .
we haven' t heard from pembury or norwich in two years !
give me the keys .
ajay , what are you smoking ?
17 seconds . once they jump from the chopper , that' s their life expectancy .
now , once i have radar , you go to 5 , 000 feet .
gideon , you and the boys bring that bitch right down on my head , and i' il take it from there .
let me stand , yeah
at that rate , we might just be getting somewhere in about 320 years .
not with my people , you won' t !
you think it' il last ?
it' s just where we can' t get .
i' il warrant there' s a nasty bog nearby .
every orc in mordor will hear this racket !
now that i' ve seen him , i do pity him .
but papa says eothain must not ride .
my old gaffer have a thing or two to say if he sees this now .
and the preciousss is wanting to go back to him .
he has led us this far , sam .
all the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of sauron .
you have two thousand good men riding north as we speak .
they will be three hundred leagues from here by now .
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them .
make him sick you will . . behaving like that
and this in turn has given rise . . to the belief that there are no dwarf women .
so few of you have returned .
what of those who cannot fight my lord ?
do i not also have your love ?
isengard . . has been unleashed .
so close to achieving his goal .
a great host , you say ?
i have fought many wars , master dwarf .
are you mad , we' il be caught !
many of these trees were my friends .
after swearing an oath to protect him !
and it' s worth fighting for .
the battle for middle earth is about to begin .
then we take the precious . . and we be the master !
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman .
what' s making that noise ?
never heard of a hobbit before .
they do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead
the air is so close in here .
why haven' t you spoken of this before ?
who knows what you' ve spoken to the darkness . . in the bitter watches of the night . . when all your life seems to shrink .
now it shall cover the grave of my son .
who will defend them if not their king ?
thoden is walking into a trap .
you can' t take your eyes off it .
our time here is ending .
but never more than memory .
we' re under attack !
faramir , orcs are on the move .
smagol , don' t struggle .
the days have gone down in the west . . behind the hills . . into shadow .
your friends are with you , aragorn .
i have told your names to the entmoot . . and we have agreed . . you are not orcs .
they have broken through !
it' s all wrong .
that there' s some good in this world , mr. frodo .
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late . . thoden king .
enough blood has been spilled on his account .
you have no idea what it did to him .
i' ve seen you .
a new power is rising .
sauron will use his puppet saruman . . to destroy the people of rohan .
in his heart , frodo begins to understand .
and two men . .
you are the the luckiest , the cunningest . . and most reckless man i ever knew !
i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms . . to be ready for battle by nightfall .
their armor is thick and their shields broad .
i' m the servant of the secret fire , wielder of the flame of anor .
every orc in mordor will hear this racket !
who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard . and mordor ?
i don' t wanna go !
freda , listen to me .
they will be small .
come on frodo , come on !
the white wizard approaches .
what is the highest technique you hope to achieve ?
ready for whatever may come .
. and to accept the consequences of his own doing .
my name is braithwaite .
we got our hands on a demonstration film of oharra .
what did the autopsy reveal as the cause of death ?
get us our evidence .
can' t really blame him .
to you i' m just another pretty face .
you were the only man outside the palace .
a man' s strength can be measured by his appetites .
we can leave immediately .
but the decision has been made .
truly if you were sith , would this contest be not over ?
it' s under control , master .
yet alone i must be for the rescue to succeed .
yes , master barrek .
before it comes to war .
i warn you , if you vote to create this army , war will follow .
many will lose their lives .
but if they do , you must realize there aren' t enough jedi to protect the republic .
with you the force is strong . young senator .
and captain typho has more than enough men downstairs .
senators are only focused on pleasing their corporations that fund their campaigns , my young
i try , master .
you' il be back here in no time .
there' s nothing to worry about . we have artoo with us .
may the force be with you .
when i' m around you , my mind is no longer my own .
he was a few years older then i . very cute . dark curly hair . dreamy eyes .
those geonosian foundries are part of the techno union .
if the senate votes the chancellor emergency powers , he could approve the use of the army in a minute .
now you can come along and protect me or stay here .
i' m sorry but if you are not going to cooperate , i must turn you over to the geonosians for justice .
the situation is that serious ?
queen jamillia has been informed of your assignment .
we will not go through this exercise again , anakin .
and you will learn your place , young one .
and so , they' ve fiinally given you an assignment .
it will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate .
as wise as master yoda and . as powerful as master windu .
but , master yoda , who could empty information from the archives ?
oh , anakin' s not a jedi yet .
they' il do their job well .
scramble code fiive to coruscant , care of the old folks' home !

what' s the racket ?
things were really bad with the funahatsi gang .
what can i say .
but you are blind .
inosuke , we' re rich for the rest of our lives !

i' m interested in one thing , neo : the future .
and then something happened , something that i knew was impossible . . but it happened anyway .
these points of intersection are crucial . . because i believe they' re vulnerable to counterattack .
the question is , do you know why you are here ?
and soon it does not matter .
we are forever slaves to it .
that is the length and breadth of the window .
though the process has altered your consciousness . . you remain irrevocably human .
concordantly , while your first question may be the most pertinent . . you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant .
but rest assured , this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it . . and we have become exceedingly efficient at it .
that you trust my .
you are right , he am .
i look for neo .
it was even of morfeo .
i say , the only reason for the one that neo am here .
and for i need it that my soldiers obey my orders .
but allow me to suggest a level of discretion , in the concerning thing to specific details .
oh , my god , they are so big !
nobody said that it would be it .
well , to my also .
is that control , not ?
but in this point it is irrelevant , what it cares is that what there is happened , it happened for a reason .
you destroyed me mr. anderson .
morpheus hasn' t filled the other positions , except for you , link .
these two got things to do .
i remember you used to dance .
there' s no point .

but by the time i knew how to say what i wanted to , it was too iate .
obviously , they wiii be freed .
what happened to my .
then i will market that acreage you blundered into the other day .
well , it' s not the sort of question . a gentleman answers .
you two boys , come on !
somehow i never thought of you as a poor loser .
well , that wasn' t very funny !
i got nothing , sir .
all right , let' s move with a purpose .
mauser , i want forward and aft guns manned at all times .
he is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world .
i do not want to be cruel , kamala .
i went to the frenchman to save my daughter .
we need your help .
down here , i' m god .
you must be ready to die .
and if you can' t find the answer . . then i' m afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us .
it is small and will force them into a bottleneck . . allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense .
i love him the same as he loves me .
they' il kill me just the same .
you have to believe me .
i say where it has to go !
why would you want that ?
you don' t think you' re coming back .

it crosses everyone' s mind at least once .
i really thought you' d be with me on this .
what the hell is going on here ?
banzai ! " yes !

it must have been our destiny .
while i was falling ,
every girl here is named after a flower .
it was a heavy blow to the' flying daggers' .
what did you say ?
why did you take such a risk ?
the' flying daggers' has many masters .
that you know all international buyers .
she claimed it was a misunderstanding . and returned the painting to the dutch government .
we have many new leads to pursue .
we are making breakfast .
i keep expecting to run into claudio or miranda .

i should call the police .
daniel has thousands of students , bruce .
the police are very tenacious .
don' t be a fool , man .
is that a problem ?
no , take it easy ?
thousands of people tuned in .
mcgovern , he reports the official story .
your father' s book was required reading in class .
yeah , she' s our news director .
that' s why we are called a news service .
he got uptight . claimed his private life was nobody' s business .
your company' s fortunes have really turned around .
alone , filming the anarchists .
you' re a walking encyclopaedia , marisa .
the security guard was female .
you' re the one that wanted to leave it alone .
yes , we can broadcast .
melts away the protective cardiac tissue .
the only reason you' re still alive is because .
but after you , my friend .
good thing your friend pedro called the police . when he saw your impromptu broadcast .
this is hank robinson for vision tv . signing off .
my brother always watches out for me .
what can i do for you ?
eric , i think your iron is getting cold .
the king would be waiting for you to kill the dragon for him ?
the f ee l .
why do you want to call him that ?
not when it comes with a curse .
you can k ee p it .

all sorts of arrangements might be made for so great a hero .
they' ve burned our towns and taken our people as slaves .
you' re just tired , father , that' s all .
my throat is dry , son .
i expect him back any day .
the one who possesses it is the treasure' s owner .
what do you have in mind ?
once you' ve removed it , you' il find a yielding maiden in your arms .
let me s ee .
but what other use has he made of it ?
now he has your sister' s hand in marriage .
those of you who ally with me . . will be rewarded with gold from the hoard .
defeat dragons with iron , but win maidens with gold !
how do we find out what they want ?
does that mean nothing ?
some magical potions to give you strength , perhaps ?
and so does siegfried .
in living life by the sword .
don' t the old ways fascinate you ?
we cannot , lady kriemhild .
do you believe me now ?
i wish , but we cannot give your brother the impression that we leave , bearing him ill will .
you may not care if men scorn you as a weakling and a cuckold .
i don' t want it anymore !
to the forest of fafnir !
my sister will marry siegfried of xanten .
welcome to my country , tamer of the fire and the elements .
this cup will hold no lesser drink than the blood of brotherhood .
it would be an honour , queen brunhild .
today i give orders for the gold to be loaded onto our ship .
after what we' ve shared . a betrayal like that .
indeed you have something that is rightfully mine .
you have done me no other greater harm .
actually , these kind of affairs scare the hell out of me .
well , i' m sure his father would be very proud of him .
i' m not interested in him .
do we even know what he looks like ?
as a sniper , you have the option to refuse the mission .
because ky mam can get you anything .
my father was an american gl , ninth battalion , 25th lnfantry .
i' ve been thinking about . how you and neil are .
